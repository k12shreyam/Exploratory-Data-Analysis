# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, 
  often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data 
  can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

- It is good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making 
sense of data in hand, before getting them dirty with it.

## By doing EDA we can answer these questions

- What questions are you trying to solve?
- What kind of data do you have and how do you treat different types?
- What's missing from the data and how do you deal with it?
- Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
- How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?

## Common plots used for EDA

- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
